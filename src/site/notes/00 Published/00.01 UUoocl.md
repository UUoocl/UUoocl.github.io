# 🪴[UUinsome](https://github.com/users/UUoocl/projects/2/views/7): Creative Thinking, Coding, Presenting

Presentations should be [[00 Published/winsome\|winsome]], whether you are presenting in-person, live online or recording a video. The UUinsome project has tools to make presentations more ... winsome.  

Make presentation slides in Obsidian, Keynote or PowerPoint that automate OBS.  Program where slides appear on the screen, change slides with a hand gesture, use your imagination to make creative expressions.    

Use the UUinsome scripts to get started, then make your own.  This is a project where you can use creative coding Javascript libraries, like P5.js or Cables.gl.  

UUinsome scripts use python, javascript and node.
