Drive OBS events with Open Sound Control (OSC) messages. 
- Set the number of connected clients
- Send messages to Text sources. 
- Return messages to clients.

OSC messages are received from a client.  A client could be an app, like ZoomOSC, or hardware, like an OBSBOT PTZ camera.  

The User configures the OSC server and creates a text sources to store and display incoming and outgoing messages.  

A text source is used because changes to a text source are easily observed by WebSocket clients.  When a text source is updated an "InputSettingsChanged" event is sent to webSocket clients.  See the [[Processing ZoomOSC Messages\|Processing ZoomOSC Messages]] tutorial for a complete example.

 1. Open the Terminal app
 2. Enter the `pip` command
 ```
 python3.11 -m pip install python-osc 
 ```

## Add the OSC io Script to OBS
The "OSC io" script and accompanying OBS Collection can be found on Github.
[python osc io repo](https://github.com/UUoocl/python_osc_io)

### Import the OSC io OBS Collection
1. Download the [OSC io Collection](https://github.com/UUoocl/Keynote_Controls/blob/main/keynote_controls.json)
2. In OBS, from the menu select `Scene Collection > Import`
3. Import the collection
4. Choose the collection `Scene Collection`

### Add the OSC io Script
1. Download the [OSC io Script](https://github.com/UUoocl/Keynote_Controls/blob/main/obs_python_keynote%20osascript.py)
2. In OBS, from the menu select `Tools > Scripts`
3. Click the `+ Add script` button

## Configure OSC Server and Clients

### Configure OSC Server
The OSC Server receives and sends messages from the OSC clients.
The OSC Server default is configured to only run on the local machine.
