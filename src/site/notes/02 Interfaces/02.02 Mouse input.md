Monitor mouse clicks, position and scroll. 
- Send position to a Text source. 
- Send clicks for mouse button 1, 2 and 3 to a Text source. 
- Send horizontal and veritcal scroll to a Text source. 

The mouse input values are passed to a Text source. 

The User creates text sources to store and display incoming position, click and scroll values.  

A text source is used because changes to a text source are easily observed by WebSocket clients.  When a text source is updated an "InputSettingsChanged" event is sent to webSocket clients.  See the [[Mouse Overlay Example\|Mouse Overlay Example]] tutorial for a complete example.
