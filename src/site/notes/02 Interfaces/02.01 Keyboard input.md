Monitor OBS hotkeys. 
- Send hotkey to a Text source. 

Keyboard keys pressed trigger OBS hotkeys.  The hotkey value is passed to a Text source. 

The User creates a text sources to store and display incoming hotkey values.  

A text source is used because changes to a text source are easily observed by WebSocket clients.  When a text source is updated an "InputSettingsChanged" event is sent to webSocket clients.  See the [[Key Overlay Example\|Key Overlay Example]] tutorial for a complete example.
