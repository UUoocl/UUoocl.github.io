Drive OBS events with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) messages. 
- Set the number of connected devices
- Send messages to Text sources. 
- Return messages to devices.

MIDI messages are received from a device.  A device could be an app, like TouchOSC, or hardware, like a MIDI controller.  

The User creates a text sources to store and display incoming and outgoing messages.  

A text source is used because changes to a text source are easily observed by WebSocket clients.  When a text source is updated an "InputSettingsChanged" event is sent to webSocket clients.  See the [[Processing MIDI Messages\|Processing MIDI Messages]] tutorial for a complete example.
